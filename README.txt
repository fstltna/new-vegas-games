SECTION 2 - INSTALLATION PROCEDURES

IMPORTANT: Encore Software recommends not running other Windows applications at the same time as installing or running this game.

Insert the game CD.  You are automatically prompted to install or run the game.  Alternatively, you can run SETUP.EXE directly from the top-level of the game CD.

SECTION 3 - VIDEO TROUBLESHOOTING

This game requires that Windows is running in 256-color mode or higher. Even though your monitor and video card may be capable of displaying 256 colors, Windows may not be set up to use this resolution. To check, double-click the Display item in the Control Panel.  Go to the Settings tab.  If the setting reads "VGA" or "16 color," you will need to change to a driver that supports 256 colors. To change video drivers, select Options, then Change System Settings.  Open the Display box to see the list of video drivers that are currently available. You should check your video card documentation for information on what 256-color driver to select. 

Be careful when changing your video drivers. If you select one that is not designed for your particular video card, Windows may not launch when you restart your computer. If this occurs, change to your Windows directory, type: SETUP, and choose the "VGA" driver again. You should then contact your video card manufacturer for the correct driver.

SECTION 4 - SOUND CARD CONFIGURATION AND SOUND ISSUES

If you experience sound problems, make sure you are using the most current drivers available for your sound card before calling technical support.  If you do not have the current Windows drivers for your sound device, you will need to contact the manufacturer of your sound device.  Check your Windows documentation or your sound device documentation for full instructions on updating your sound drivers.

SECTION 5 - INTERNET INFORMATION (REQUIRES WINDOWS 95)

Logging On

To play a network game, you must first connect to the Internet via your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Start your Internet software and leave it running, then run the game and click on the Internet Connection graphic. 

Note: You must have at least a 56 Kbps or faster modem.
Your Internet access must be a TCP/IPconnection.  Contact your Internet Service Provider if you are unsure whether they provide this type of access, or if you have questions regarding how to connect to the Internet.


Network Game Troubleshooting

When you attempt to start a multiplayer game, you may experience difficulties in establishing a connection with other players. Before you contact technical support, please check the following:

? Are you connected to the Internet? You must create an open Internet connection to start a network game.
? Are you running Windows 95 or 98? 

If you are running Windows 95 and you are connected to the Internet, but are still having troubles connecting to other players, you may want to attempt to log in several times. Other players may not be available at all times, but only for short periods of time.
